					<h4>2010 - LA CONSÉCRATION POUR SAINZ</h4>

					For the second South American edition of the Dakar, 88 bikes, 14 quads, 57 cars and 28 trucks managed to return to Buenos Aires after a 9,000-km journey. Cyril Despres picked up a third title in the bike race, whilst Argentinean Marcos Patronelli was victorious in the quad category. In the car race, Carlos Sainz triumphed at the end of a ferocious and uncompromising struggle with Nasser Al Attiyah. At the finishing line, the two drivers were separated by the smallest gap in the history of the rally: 2’12’’. The race was much more relaxed for Vladimir Chagin, who could not stop collecting records as the event went on: he is now tied with Karel Loprais on six titles in the truck category and pushed his total of stage victories up to 56!
					<h4>2009 - CELEBRATED LIKE HEROES</h4>

					The 31st edition of the Dakar, the first one in Latin-America, is now over and has seen the victories of Marc Coma in the bike category, Josef Machacek in the quad category, Giniel De Villiers in the car category and Firdaus Kabirov in the truck category. In total, 113 bikers, 13 quad riders, 91 car teams and 54 truck teams finished the rally-raid, that was notably marked by the exceptional enthusiasm the Dakar generated amongst the crowds in Argentina and in Chile.
					<h4>2008 - SECURITY AS A PRIORITY</h4>

					After the murder of four French citizens and three Mauritanian soldiers in the previous days before the start and answering the strong recommendation of the French Ministry for Foreign affairs not to go to Mauritania, the 2008 edition of the rally was cancelled. Terrorist acts identified by the French authorities threatened the rally directly. On the eve of the start, Etienne Lavigne was forced to announce the cancellation of the 2008 edition. The competitors gathered in Lisbon for scrutineering had to deal with the shock and saluted the responsible decision of the organisers. Three weeks later (Friday the 1st of February) a terror attack in the heart of Nouakchott confirmed the judiciousness of applying the precaution principle.
					<h4>2007 - PETERHANSEL MAKES IT 9</h4>

					231 bikers, 14 quads,181 teams in cars and 85 trucks lined up at the start in Lisbon. At the finish, the all-terrain action hero Stéphane Peterhansel took his total number of Dakar victories to nine. After six wins on a bike, he proceeded to show similar dominance on four wheels, outdoing not only his team-mate Luc Alphand but also his Volkswagen rivals, Carlos Sainz and Giniel De Villiers.
					<h4>2005 - A BLUE BIKE AT THE SUMMIT</h4>

					The motorcyclist Cyril Despres dedicated his victory to Richard Sainct, who had died a few weeks earlier during the Pharaohs Rally, and to Fabrizio Meoni. His two team-mates at KTM paid for their passion for the desert with their lives, as did Juan-Manuel Perez, the victim of a fatal fall.
					<h4>2001 - KLEINSCHMIDT, "MISS DAKAR"</h4>

					Jutta Kleinschmidt, first seen in the Dakar thirteen years earlier on a bike, had already become the first female stage winner in 1998 in a Schlesser buggy. This year, she became the first woman to win the overall event, this time at the wheel of a Mitsubishi.
					<h4>2000 - A BLUE BUGGY IN CAIRO</h4>

					To mark the new millennium, the Dakar opted for a route with an eternal flavour: the finish was at the foot of the Gizeh Pyramids, where the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt lie. Jean-Louis Schlesser, who remains the only person towin the Dakar on a buggy, retained his title, as did Richard Sainct in the bike category.
