					A powerful knockout artist, Anthony Joshua helped revitalize the heavyweight division.
					Although he started his boxing career somewhat late, he quickly ascended up the amateur
					ranks and ended up winning an Olympic gold medal at super heavyweight, and then later
					the IBF heavyweight title, making him only the second British boxer to win gold at the
					Olympics and also a world title.
					Born in Watford, England to Nigerian parents, Joshua spent his early years back and
					forth between the United Kingdom and Nigeria. By the middle of his Year Seven, he was
					in the United Kingdom full time at Kings Langley Secondary School. He was always a natural
					athlete, as he did well in football and also ended up breaking the 100-meter record for Year
					Nine students when he ran it in just 11.6 second.
					While he did a couple sessions of boxing training with his father at 15, he wasn’t interested
					in the sport at the time, preferring weightlifting and spending time with his friends.
					In 2007 when he was 18, he really committed to the sport and started training full time.
					This meant he was getting to it later than most, although athletic heavyweights can get away with that.
					He had immediate success when he started competing as an amateur, as he ended up winning
					both the 2009 and 2010 Haringey Box Cup, followed by the Senior ABA Championships in 2010.
					Despite his success in the ring, Anthony Joshua had his share of problems outside of it.
					He had been getting in trouble with the law since he was 16, at one point throwing another
					player over his shoulders during a game of football. That resulted in an official warning.
					He also got in his fair share of street fights, one of which led to him being on remand in Reading.
					His success in boxing didn’t lead him down the right path immediately, as even after
					he started collecting those amateur tournament trophies, he still got arrested in 2010
					for having marijuana in his car.
					Despite these issues, the heavyweight didn’t let himself get off track, as he continued
					to focus on his goals of winning tournaments. Despite an offer of 50,000 pounds to fight
					professionally in 2010, he turned it down because he wanted to remain an amateur.
					He instead took a place on the GB Boxing team, and he ended up winning the 2010
					GB Amateur Boxing Championships. He took a step up in competition the next year when he
					fought in the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships, but a southpaw, Mihai Nistor,
					ended up stopping him.
					The 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships served as a coming out party for the boxer.
					Despite having only 4 years of experience at the time, he beat the tournament’s reigning
					champion Roberto Cammarelle and followed it up with a victory in the semifinals. He faced off
					with Magomedrasul Majidov in the finals but lost by just a point, ending up with the silver medal.
					His tournament performance was good enough to earn him a place in the 2012 Olympics.
